## Audio Animated

#### Overview

Audio Animated Allows users to record audio or upload audio files either collaboratively (asynchronously) or as a single user to produce a musical composition of the overlayed separate recordings.

All of this will be accompanied by a beautiful rendered animation of the music.

Ideally (maybe outside of MVP) the animation will also be expressive of a dimension of the music creation (either showing different user contributions or chrologloically when a user added a track).

There will be a user configuration setting to pick things like color scheme.

### POC (Proof of Concept)

We want to ensure everything that we outline in our MVP is possible before we get too far into the project. The proof of concept work will include:

- Create animation from audio
- Being able to combine two audio files into a single track (and have the timing match up)

### MVP

User's will be able to:

- Upload or record a "sound track"
- Overlay a new sound track on top of what is already recorded

An animation will be created of the most recent combined track.

Then users can :

- Download a video of the combined animation and audio

### Stretch Goals

- Add additional video editing for specific platforms (e.g tic toc etc )
- Conifigure the animation engine
- Express different dimensions in the animation. E.g show which users contributed to what or show when items were added
- Be able to make user edits to the animation
- Allow users to create NFTs, so they own their artwork, not us

#### Technical Challenges

- Users being able to listen to the existing track whilst they are recording
- Creating the overlapped music without any latency issues
- Storing and moving the music
- Probably things we havhent thought of :D new territory
